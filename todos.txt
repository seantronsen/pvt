- make it such that stateful widgets can be added to multiple panes. no need to
	de-duplicate the widgets such that only one appears, but make it such that a
	state update for one causes the other to re-render appropriately. as for the
	pane state, we can set it up such that the stateful pane still only keeps the
	single widget state, but the stateful widget can keep the state of multiple
	panes. when the widget calls the flush operation, it will do so for all
	associated panes.
