- my current gripe with this software is that setting up the application
	remains somewhat tedious. it's definitely better than it could be, but having
	to enchain all items individually is a task.


	what if we made it such that we can add panes to the app viewer 
		for each new pane that's added, check it's type and see if it's inheriting from the stateful widget. 
			if it is, then enchain that widget with all stateful panes.
