- do another round of speed testing.

- need to implement a top level pane that conducts scan line analysis of images

- consider adding qsplitter

- it would be a hell of a lot more efficient if we could take the results from
	one of the callbacks and allow the other callbacks to use them. but... this
	is where coupling starts to be a problem. do the other callbacks need to
	wait? what should the order be?

- need to add some sort of identifier to each display pane when involving
	performance logs. such will allow them to be filtered later on and enable
	focus on particular panes.

- the trackbar impl. still pisses me off. would be nice if it could be such
	that dragging the slider also moves it by the step size instead of by 1. the
	ticks should be adjusted to work with this constraint too. we're simply
	processing too many events for sliders with large ranges of values even if qt
	does discard most of them. really it wouldn't have to discard as many if the
	step size was applied to dragging.

- animation flickers for plot demo under cetain settings. likely something to
	do with either the callback processing, the frame rate relative to the
	monitor, etc.

- need to add some sort of support for different colored plots and colormaps for image plots.

- (backburner): add support for surface and probabilistic plots.
	- this includes 3D plots.
