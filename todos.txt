- do another round of speed testing.
- codebase could probably use some cleaning up
- need to implement a line plotting utility, similar to the matplotlib standard plot function.
- need to implement a video and / or animation pane viewer
- need to implement a top level pane that conducts scan line analysis of images



- consider adding qsplitter


- it would be a hell of a lot more efficient if we could take the results from
	one of the callbacks and allow the other callbacks to use them. but... this is where coupling starts to be a problem. do the other callbacks need to wait? what should the order be?
